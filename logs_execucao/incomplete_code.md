# Incomplete Code

Here's an incomplete code example based on the provided complete code. This version has certain parts removed or masked for students to fill in, allowing them to practice their understanding of Python fundamentals.

```python
# Python Fundamentals - Variables and Control Flow

# 1. Introduction to Python
# Python is a versatile programming language used in web development, data science, automation, and more.

# 2. Variables in Python
# Definition: A variable is a container for storing data values.

# Declaring variables
x = ____  # Integer variable
y = ____  # Float variable
name = ____  # String variable
is_active = ____  # Boolean variable

# Printing the values of the variables
print("Integer:", x)
print("Float:", y)
print("String:", name)
print("Boolean:", is_active)

# Variable Naming Conventions
# Valid variable names: my_variable, variable1, _temp
# Invalid variable names: 1variable, my variable (spaces not allowed)

# 3. Data Types in Python
# Demonstrating type conversion
print("\nType Conversion:")
age = "____"  # age is a string
age_as_integer = int(age)  # Convert string to integer
print("Age as integer:", age_as_integer)

# 4. Control Flow in Python

# Conditional Statements
print("\nConditional Statements:")
if x > ____:
    print("x is greater than 5")
elif x == ____:
    print("x is equal to 5")
else:
    print("x is less than 5")

# Loops
print("\nFor Loop:")
# Using a for loop to iterate over a range of numbers
for i in range(____):
    print("Iteration:", i)

print("\nWhile Loop:")
# Using a while loop to increment x until it's less than 10
while x < ____:
    print("Current x:", x)
    x += 1  # Increment x by 1

# Break and Continue Statements
print("\nBreak and Continue Statements:")
for i in range(____):
    if i == ____:
        print("Breaking the loop at i =", i)
        break  # Exit the loop when i is 5
    print("Current i:", i)

print("\nUsing Continue Statement:")
for i in range(____):
    if i % ____ == 0:
        continue  # Skip even numbers
    print("Odd number:", i)

# 5. Conclusion
# This code covered variables, data types, conditional statements, and loops.
# Feel free to ask any questions for clarification!
```

### Instructions for the Student:
1. Fill in the gaps (represented by `____`) with appropriate values or expressions to complete the code.
2. Ensure that the code runs without errors after you fill in the missing parts.
3. Use the comments provided to guide your understanding of each section and the concepts being implemented. 

This exercise will help reinforce your understanding of variables, data types, control flow, and loops in Python.
