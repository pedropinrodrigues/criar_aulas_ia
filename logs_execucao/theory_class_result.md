# Python Fundamentals - Variables and Control Flow

## Class Overview
This class is designed for beginners to introduce them to the fundamental concepts of Python programming. The focus will be on understanding variables, data types, and control flow structures such as conditional statements and loops. By the end of the session, students will have a foundational understanding of how to declare variables, utilize different data types, and implement basic control flow mechanisms in their Python programs.

### Duration
45 minutes

## Class Content

### 1. Introduction to Python (5 minutes)
- Brief overview of Python as a programming language.
- Importance of Python in various domains (web development, data science, etc.).

### 2. Variables in Python (10 minutes)
- **Definition of a Variable**: Explanation of what a variable is and its purpose in programming.
- **Declaring Variables**: Syntax for declaring variables in Python.
  - Example: `x = 5`
- **Variable Naming Conventions**: Rules for naming variables (e.g., no spaces, cannot start with a number, etc.).
- **Dynamic Typing**: Explanation of how Python is dynamically typed (no need to declare data types explicitly).

### 3. Data Types in Python (10 minutes)
- **Basic Data Types**:
  - **Integers**: Whole numbers (e.g., `x = 10`).
  - **Floats**: Decimal numbers (e.g., `y = 10.5`).
  - **Strings**: Text data (e.g., `name = "John"`).
  - **Booleans**: True or False values (e.g., `is_active = True`).
- **Type Conversion**: How to convert between data types using built-in functions (e.g., `int()`, `float()`, `str()`).
- **Examples and Practice**: Simple examples demonstrating each data type.

### 4. Control Flow in Python (15 minutes)
- **Conditional Statements**:
  - **if Statement**: Syntax and usage.
    - Example: 
      ```python
      if x > 5:
          print("x is greater than 5")
      ```
  - **if-else Statement**: Adding alternative conditions.
  - **elif Statement**: Handling multiple conditions.
- **Loops**:
  - **for Loop**: Iterating over a sequence (e.g., lists, strings).
    - Example:
      ```python
      for i in range(5):
          print(i)
      ```
  - **while Loop**: Repeating as long as a condition is true.
    - Example:
      ```python
      while x < 10:
          x += 1
      ```
- **Break and Continue Statements**: Controlling loop execution.

### 5. Conclusion and Q&A (5 minutes)
- Recap of the key points covered in the class.
- Open the floor for questions and clarifications.
