# Python Fundamentals - Variables and Control Flow

## Class Overview
This class is designed for beginners who are eager to learn the fundamentals of 
Python programming. We will focus on understanding variables, data types, and 
control structures, which are essential for writing effective Python code.

### Duration
**45 minutes**

## Class Content

### 1. Introduction to Python (5 minutes)
   - Brief overview of Python as a programming language.
   - Importance of learning Python for various applications (web development, 
     data science, automation, etc.).

### 2. Variables in Python (10 minutes)
   - **Definition**: What is a variable?
   - **Declaring Variables**: Syntax for declaring variables.
     - Example: `x = 10`
   - **Variable Naming Conventions**: Rules for naming variables (e.g., no spaces, 
     cannot start with a number).
   - **Dynamic Typing**: Explanation of how Python handles variable types dynamically.

### 3. Data Types (10 minutes)
   - **Basic Data Types**:
     - **Integers**: Whole numbers (e.g., `5`, `-3`).
     - **Floats**: Decimal numbers (e.g., `3.14`, `-0.001`).
     - **Strings**: Text data (e.g., `"Hello, World!"`).
     - **Booleans**: True or False values.
   - **Type Conversion**: How to convert between data types.
     - Example: `int("10")` converts a string to an integer.
   - **Using the `type()` function**: Demonstrating how to check variable types.

### 4. Control Flow (15 minutes)
   - **Conditional Statements**:
     - **If Statements**: Syntax and examples.
       - Example: 
         ```python
         if x > 10:
             print("x is greater than 10")
         ```
     - **Else and Elif**: How to use them for multiple conditions.
       - Example:
         ```python
         if x > 10:
             print("x is greater than 10")
         elif x < 10:
             print("x is less than 10")
         else:
             print("x is equal to 10")
         ```
   - **Loops**:
     - **For Loops**: Iterating over a sequence.
       - Example:
         ```python
         for i in range(5):
             print(i)
         ```
     - **While Loops**: Executing as long as a condition is true.
       - Example:
         ```python
         while x < 10:
             x += 1
         ```
   - **Break and Continue Statements**: Controlling loop execution.

### 5. Practical Examples and Exercises (5 minutes)

except ValueError:
    print("Invalid input! Please enter a valid integer.")

# End of the code example
```

**Explanation of the Code:**
1. **Variables**: We declare variables of different types (integer, float, string, 
   boolean) and print their types using the `type()` function.
2. **Type Conversion**: Demonstrates converting a string to an integer.
3. **Control Flow**: 
   - Conditional statements check the value of `x` and print relevant messages.
   - A `for` loop iterates from 0 to 4 and prints each number.
   - A `while` loop increments `x` until it reaches 15.
   - Demonstrates `break` to exit a loop when a condition is met and `continue` 
     to skip even numbers.
4. **Practical Exercise**: Prompts the user for input and checks if the entered 
   number is even or odd, handling invalid input gracefully.

This code can be executed directly in a Python environment and serves as a 
practical illustration of the fundamental concepts discussed in the theory 
documentation.

fundamental programming concepts such as variables, data types, control flow, 
loops, and user input handling. Completing this code will not only enhance your 
understanding of Python syntax but also build your confidence in writing 
functional code. These skills are essential for developing more complex programs 
in the future.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this exercise, you will learn to:
- Declare and initialize variables of different data types.
- Use the `type()` function to check variable types.
- Perform type conversion between strings and integers.
- Implement conditional statements to control the flow of the program.
- Use `for` and `while` loops for repetitive tasks.
- Understand and apply `break` and `continue` statements in loops.
- Handle user input and exceptions effectively.

## Setup Instructions
No special setup or imports are required for this exercise. You can run the 
Python code in any environment that supports Python 3.x, such as:
- Local Python installation
- Online Python interpreters (e.g., Replit, Google Colab)
- Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) like PyCharm or VS Code

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Declare Variables
**Missing Part:**  
```python
x = ____  # Integer
y = ____  # Float
name = "____"  # String
is_student = ____  # Boolean
```
**Functionality Missing:** You need to define values for `x`, `y`, `name`, and 
`is_student`. 

**Hints:** 
- For `x`, think of a small whole number.
- For `y`, consider a decimal number.
- `name` should be a string representing your name.
- `is_student` should be `True` or `False` depending on your status.
  
### 2. Type Conversion
**Missing Part:**
```python
string_number = "____"
converted_number = ____  # Convert string to integer
```
**Functionality Missing:** You need to assign a string to `string_number` and 
convert it to an integer.

**Hints:** 
- Use a numeric string (e.g., "42").
- Use the `int()` function for conversion.

### 3. Control Flow Examples
**Conditional Statements**

**Missing Parts:** 
```python
if x ____ 10:  # Fill in the condition
elif x ____ 10:  # Fill in the condition
```
**Functionality Missing:** You need to define conditions to compare `x` with 10.

**Hints:**
- Use comparison operators like `>`, `<`, or `==`.

### 4. For Loop Example
**Missing Part:**
```python
for i in range(____):  # Fill in the range
```
**Functionality Missing:** You need to specify the range for the loop.

**Hints:**
- If you want to count from 0 to 4, use `5` in `range(____)`.

### 5. While Loop Example
**Missing Part:**
```python
while x ____ 15:  # Fill in the condition
```
**Functionality Missing:** Define a condition to decide when to stop the loop.

**Hints:**
- Use `<` to keep incrementing `x` until it reaches 15.

### 6. Break and Continue Statements
**Missing Parts:**
```python
for i in range(____):  # Fill in the range
if i ____ 5:  # Fill in the condition
```
**Functionality Missing:** Specify the range and the condition for breaking the loop.

**Hints:**
- For the range, you might want to choose a number like `10`.
- For the condition, consider when you want to exit the loop.

### 7. Continue Example
**Missing Part:**
```python
for i in range(____):  # Fill in the range
if i % 2 ____ 0:  # Fill in the condition
```
**Functionality Missing:** Specify the range and the condition to skip even numbers.

**Hints:**
- Use `10` for the range.
- Use the modulus operator `%` to check for even numbers.

### 8. Practical Exercise
**Missing Parts:**
```python
number = ____  # Convert user input to integer
if number % 2 ____ 0:  # Fill in the condition
```
**Functionality Missing:** You need to convert the user input and check if the 
number is even or odd.

**Hints:**
- Use `int()` to convert the input.
- Use `% 2` to check for evenness.

## Expected Output
When the code is complete, it should:
- Print variable types.
- Convert a string to an integer and display the result.
- Evaluate conditions based on the value of `x`.
- Count using loops and demonstrate breaking and continuing in loops.
- Determine if a user-provided number is even or odd.

## Challenges (Optional)
- Modify the code to allow the user to input `x` and perform the checks dynamically.
- Extend the program to count downwards using a `while` loop.

## Testing Tips
- After completing the code, run it to check for syntax errors.
- Test with different values for `x`, `y`, and user input to ensure it behaves 
  as expected in all scenarios.
- Carefully observe the output for any logical errors and debug accordingly.

> **Important Tips:**
> - Remember to take your time and think through each section carefully
> - Don't hesitate to refer back to the theory documentation
> - Test your code incrementally as you fill in each blank
> - Use print statements to debug if something doesn't work as expected

Happy coding! Make sure to take your time and think through each section. You'll 
find that filling in these gaps will solidify your understanding of Python 
fundamentals.
